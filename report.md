# Website Front-End Formatting and Spacing Improvement Report

## 1. Analysis of Current Design

I reviewed the existing website layout and identified the following areas for improvement:

- **Inconsistent Spacing and Padding:** Spacing and padding were inconsistent across different sections.
- **Hardcoded Styles:** Many components used inline styles, making them difficult to maintain and adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Embedded CSS:** CSS was embedded in the component files, which is not a good practice.
- **Lack of Responsiveness:** The website was not fully responsive, and some elements did not display correctly on mobile devices.

## 2. Changes Made

I made the following changes to improve the website's front-end design:

- **Standardized Spacing and Padding:** I standardized the spacing and padding across all elements to enhance readability and visual appeal.
- **Externalized CSS:** I moved all embedded CSS to separate files, which makes the code more maintainable.
- **Removed Hardcoded Styles:** I removed all hardcoded styles and replaced them with TailwindCSS classes.
- **Improved Responsiveness:** I applied responsive design principles to ensure that all elements adjust appropriately across different screen sizes.

## 3. Testing and Validation

I conducted thorough testing on various devices and screen sizes to validate the changes. I also used browser developer tools to simulate different devices and screen resolutions.
